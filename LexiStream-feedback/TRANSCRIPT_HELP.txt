              LEXISTREAM - TRANSCRIPTION HELP GUIDE
================================================================================

If you see errors related to audio transcription (for example:
"Transcription failed" or messages about audio or speech recognition),
this guide explains what you can do to help fix or improve it.

================================================================================
1. COMMON CAUSES OF TRANSCRIPT ERRORS
================================================================================

1) No internet connection
   - The app uses Google's free Web Speech API via the SpeechRecognition
     Python library. This requires an active internet connection.

2) Poor audio quality
   - Loud background noise
   - Microphone too far away
   - Very low volume

3) Audio format / codec issues
   - The browser recording is converted to WAV using the pydub library.
   - On some systems, pydub needs FFmpeg installed to read/convert audio.

4) Service-side limitations
   - The free Google Web Speech API sometimes fails due to rate limits
     or temporary server-side problems.

================================================================================
2. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP TRANSCRIPTION
================================================================================

STEP A: CHECK YOUR INTERNET
---------------------------
- Make sure you are connected to the internet.
- Try opening any website in your browser to confirm.
- If your internet drops, transcription will fail.

STEP B: IMPROVE YOUR RECORDING ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------------------
- Find a quiet room (reduce TV, fans, and background noise).
- Speak clearly and at a normal pace.
- Keep the microphone at a consistent distance from your mouth.
- Avoid covering the microphone with your hand or other objects.

STEP C: INSTALL FFMPEG (IF NEEDED)
----------------------------------
If you see errors mentioning "FFmpeg", "decode", or audio file formats,
you may need FFmpeg so that pydub can convert the audio properly.

1) Download FFmpeg for Windows:
   - Go to: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
   - Choose a Windows build (e.g., from gyan.dev or BtbN)

2) Extract FFmpeg:
   - Extract the folder (for example: C:\ffmpeg)

3) Add FFmpeg to the PATH (simplest way):
   - Press Win + R, type: sysdm.cpl  and press Enter
   - Go to the "Advanced" tab > "Environment Variables..."
   - In "System variables", find "Path" and click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add the path to ffmpeg\bin, e.g.:
     C:\ffmpeg\bin
   - Click OK on all dialogs to save

4) Close and reopen Command Prompt
   - Type: ffmpeg -version
   - If you see version information, FFmpeg is installed correctly.

LexiStream will now have a much easier time converting and reading audio.

STEP D: TRY A SHORTER RECORDING
-------------------------------
- Very long recordings are harder to transcribe and more likely to fail.
- Try recording 15–30 seconds to test if the system works.

================================================================================
3. UNDERSTANDING ERROR MESSAGES
================================================================================

You might see flash messages such as:

- "Transcription error: Could not understand audio. Please speak more clearly."
  -> The audio reached Google, but it couldn't clearly detect words.
     Try again with clearer speech and less noise.

- "Transcription error: Error with speech recognition service: ..."
  -> Network or Google-side issue. Check internet and try later.

- "Error processing audio: ..."
  -> Problem reading or converting the audio file. FFmpeg and pydub setup
     are the most common causes. Follow STEP C.

If you see a specific error message in the terminal, you can:
- Copy it
- Save it in your documentation
- Or share it with someone helping you debug

================================================================================
4. SUMMARY: YOUR CHECKLIST
================================================================================

1. Internet is ON and stable
2. Quiet room, clear speech, good microphone position
3. FFmpeg installed and on PATH (ffmpeg -version works)
4. Try shorter test recordings first
5. Re-run the app after making changes:
   - Close the app (Ctrl + C in Command Prompt)
   - Open a new Command Prompt
   - cd "C:\JAMMIE CODING\LexiStream"
   - py app.py

================================================================================
If you still see repeated transcript errors after all of this, note down:
- The exact error message shown in LexiStream
- Any extra error text in the Command Prompt
- What you were trying to record (approx. length, language)

This information is VERY helpful for debugging and for your project report.
